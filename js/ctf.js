Every service running on a computer listens on a numbered "port" — web servers use port 80, email uses port 25, and so on.\n\nNmap is the tool everyone uses for this. The -sV flag makes it figure out what software is running on each open port. The -sC flag runs a set of built-in checks to grab extra info automatically.\n\nWhen you scan a Windows Domain Controller you\'ll see port 88 (that\'s Kerberos — the login system), port 389 (LDAP — the user directory), and port 445 (SMB — Windows file sharing).

This is called a "null session."\n\nenum4linux automates this. It connects to the target and asks it questions that a normal Windows computer would ask, like "who are the users here?" and "what are the password rules?"\n\nFrom this scan we learn the domain name (CORP.LOCAL), all the usernames (john.doe, svc_backup, svc_sql, svc_web), and that accounts lock out after 5 wrong password attempts.

People do this all the time — they save passwords in text files, sticky notes, or shared drives because it\'s convenient. Now we need to check if that password actually works on the main server.\n\nCrackMapExec (CME) is a tool that tests credentials against Windows machines. You give it a username, a password, and a target, and it tells you if the login works.\n\nA [+] result means success — we have a real, working domain account. This is our first foothold.

To help Windows find these services, each one is registered with a "Service Principal Name" (SPN) — basically a label that says "this account runs this service."\n\nHere\'s the attack: any normal domain user can ask the Domain Controller for a Kerberos "ticket" to access any of these services. The DC encrypts that ticket using the service account\'s password. We can take that encrypted ticket home and try to crack it offline.\n\nThis step just lists the available targets.

The DC does exactly what it\'s supposed to do — it creates a ticket, encrypts it with the service account\'s password hash, and hands it to us. No alarms, no errors, completely normal behaviour.\n\nThe trick is that we don\'t actually need to use these tickets to access the services. We just need the encrypted data inside them, because that encrypted data was created using the service account\'s password.

We give it our captured tickets and a wordlist — rockyou.txt contains 14 million real passwords leaked from actual data breaches over the years.\n\nService accounts are a weak point because IT teams often set them up once with a simple password and never change them.

Here we find a folder called CORP_DATA containing financial records, HR files with employee SSNs, and a customer credit card database with 23,452 records including card numbers, CVVs, expiry dates, and social security numbers.\n\nThis is a full PCI-DSS breach — the kind that results in millions in fines, mandatory customer notification, and potential criminal charges.\n\nThe entire attack chain took one weak service account password.
